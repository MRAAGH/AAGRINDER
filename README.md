# AAGRINDER
2D sanbox multiplayer game you can play in the browser

# How can I play?
You need to know a link to an aagrinder server.

You just enter this link into your browser and start playing!
It is that simple! :D

# How to find a server?
I don't have a public server, and I don't know of any other servers.
This might change in the future.
But for now, you will probably need to set up your own server with your friends.

# How to run a server?
```
$ git clone git@github.com:MRAAGH/aagrinder.git
$ cd aagrinder
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

A server.properties file will be created.
You can open and modify it if you wish, then restart the server.

You also need to configure ports and IP's if you want others to be able to connect.
But this is advanced stuff.
If you don't know what I am talking about, maybe you should find someone else to host the server ^.^

# How finished is the game?
Very unfinished at this point.
Hardly playable and it looks and feels different than it is supposed to.
I need to get to work, hehe
